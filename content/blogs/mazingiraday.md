## Commemorating Mazingira Day with WeRunNairobi

On Mazingira Day, I found myself lacing up for a run with WeRunNairobi, and it turned out to be a really rewarding experience. We ran through the Nairobi Arboretum, which was nothing short of serene—trees everywhere, and a peaceful atmosphere that made me forget I was in the middle of the Nairobi.

It was one of those moments where I realized just how much the environment gives back to us when we take care of it. The fresh air, the beautiful scenery, and the overall calming vibe made me appreciate the importance of preserving these spaces. It felt like nature’s way of reminding us that when we look after the environment, it looks after us too.

The run was refreshing—not just physically but mentally too. It really drove home the point that we should all do our part, no matter how small, to protect and nurture our surroundings. I’m looking forward to more runs like this, not just for fitness but as a way to connect with nature and give back to it.
