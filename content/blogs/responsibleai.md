## Lessons from EY's Responsible AI Badge
Recently, I finished EY’s Responsible AI badge, and it was a real eye-opener. I went into the course hoping to better understand the ethical implications of working with AI, especially generative models like ChatGPT. My focus was on learning how to protect client data when it came to AI, while also ensuring that I stay ethical when using these powerful tools.

Two courses in particular stood out: *Data Science Ethics* and *Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, and Ethics*, both from Coursera. They weren’t just theoretical but dove deep into real-world examples, showing the impact of bias, fairness, and transparency. It was fascinating to see how privacy and accountability are not just technical issues but ethical ones too. The courses made me rethink the way we interact with AI—there’s a lot more to consider beyond just the technical efficiency of these systems.

What really hit home for me was how relevant this all is today. The more AI grows, the more responsibility we have to ensure it’s used ethically. Whether it’s safeguarding client data or being aware of the bias that can creep into AI models, we have to be intentional. This badge reinforced that we’re not just working with tools—we’re influencing the future of tech and its impact on society. 

The reflection on how far AI has come and where it’s going was another highlight. AI’s journey has been fast, but it’s clear that the ethical issues around it are growing just as quickly. Taking this badge made me more conscious of the responsibility we carry in shaping AI for good, especially as it becomes more integrated into everyday life.
