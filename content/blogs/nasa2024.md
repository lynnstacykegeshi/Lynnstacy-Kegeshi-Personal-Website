## Bridging Theory and Practice in Actuarial Science
I was honored to be invited back as a recent alumna for the **University of Nairobi Actuarial Students Association (NASA) Career Day**, held under the theme *"Exploring Actuarial Science: Bridging Theory and Practice."* This topic really resonated with me, as it’s something I grappled with during my undergraduate years—trying to understand how the theory we learned would eventually translate into real-world practice.

At the time, like many actuarial students, I found myself questioning, *Where would I fit in?* When people hear “actuarial science,” they often think of traditional roles in life insurance or pensions. But as I’ve discovered, there are so many more directions this degree can take us, far beyond those conventional paths. That’s why I was excited to not only listen to the esteemed panel but also to speak with the students and share my personal journey.

During the event, we had a panel discussion featuring experts from **life insurance, general insurance, investment**, and **data science**. It was fascinating to hear how these professionals have navigated their careers and how the actuarial profession continues to evolve. They showcased the diversity of opportunities available to actuaries today and how the skills we learn—like **risk management, data analysis**, and **financial modeling**—are in demand across so many different industries.

Reflecting on my own experience, I recalled how I hadn’t initially planned to study actuarial science. I was placed into the program and, like many students, was drawn to it because of my love for math. Over time, I became particularly interested in the **statistical and analytical aspects** of the field. However, understanding how these skills would apply to the workforce took time, and like many, I was uncertain about where my career would take me.

Today, I’m working as a **Tax Advisor** at Ernst & Young, specializing in **Transfer Pricing** and **International Tax**. It’s not a role that would typically be associated with actuarial science, but the core skills I developed—particularly around risk quantification and analysis—have been incredibly valuable. In tax, just like in actuarial work, we constantly assess financial implications and ensure compliance with ever-evolving regulations.

## The Diverse Opportunities in Actuarial Science
One of the key points I wanted to remind the students about was the **breadth of the actuarial profession**. According to the [Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFoA)](https://actuaries.org.uk/practice-areas/), actuarial science encompasses a diverse range of fields, many of which extend far beyond the traditional scope of insurance. Actuaries can venture into various practice areas, including:

- Life Insurance
- General Insurance (Non-life)
- Pensions and Retirement
- Investment
- Health and Care
- Risk Management
- Data Science and Analytics
- Banking and Finance
- Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)
- Climate Change and Sustainability

This reminder was important because it highlights just how versatile actuarial skills are, and how many ventures actuaries can go into. The industry is evolving rapidly, and there are so many exciting opportunities ahead for students to explore.

Overall, it was such a rewarding experience to engage with the students, share insights, and reflect on the importance of **bridging the gap between theory and practice**. It’s something we all struggle with at some point during our academic journey, but it’s essential to remember that the theoretical knowledge we gain is what allows us to make real-world impacts later on.

As I look ahead, I’m excited to continue shaping a future where theory drives **impactful practice**, and I hope to inspire the next generation of actuaries to explore all the diverse paths that lie ahead for them.
