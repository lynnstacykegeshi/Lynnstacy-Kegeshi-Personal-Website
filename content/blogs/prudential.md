## Celebrating Achievement: Receiving the Prudential Award

On May 3rd, I had the incredible honor of receiving the Prudential Award during the Student Recognition Ceremony at the University of Nairobi for the academic year 2022/2023. This prestigious award recognizes the top Actuarial Science students and highlights the importance of academic excellence in our field.

The Prudential Award is part of the Prudential Actuarial Support System (PASS), an initiative by Prudential Kenya that aims to support and mentor Actuarial Science students, fostering growth and resilience in the industry. It’s not just about recognition; it’s about creating a community of future leaders in actuarial science.

Receiving this award was not just a personal achievement; it was a reflection of the hard work and dedication I put into my studies. I am grateful for the support from my professors, fellow students, and everyone who contributed to my journey. This experience reinforced my belief in the importance of mentorship and collaboration within our field.

As I look to the future, I am motivated to leverage this recognition to contribute positively to the actuarial community. 

Receiving the Prudential Award has been a highlight of my academic journey. It serves as a reminder of the value of hard work, resilience, and the importance of nurturing future talent in the actuarial field. I am excited to see where this path leads me and am grateful for the opportunities ahead.
