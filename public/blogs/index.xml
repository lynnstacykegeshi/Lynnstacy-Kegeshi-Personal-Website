      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;building-a-website-with-r-and-rstudio&#34;&gt;Building a Website with R and RStudio&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you think of R programming, one of the first things that come to mind is its usefulness as a tool for data analysis and visualization. It’s a powerful tool for statistical computing. But did you know that you can also build a website with R and RStudio? Using Hugo themes as your starting point, you can deploy a website on Netlify free of charge! Here’s a rough summary of how to get started.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Responsible AI (EY Badge)</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-from-eys-responsible-ai-badge&#34;&gt;Lessons from EY&amp;rsquo;s Responsible AI Badge&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I finished EY’s Responsible AI badge, and it was a real eye-opener. I went into the course hoping to better understand the ethical implications of working with AI, especially generative models like ChatGPT. My focus was on learning how to protect client data when it came to AI, while also ensuring that I stay ethical when using these powerful tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two courses in particular stood out: &lt;em&gt;Data Science Ethics&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, and Ethics&lt;/em&gt;, both from Coursera. They weren’t just theoretical but dove deep into real-world examples, showing the impact of bias, fairness, and transparency. It was fascinating to see how privacy and accountability are not just technical issues but ethical ones too. The courses made me rethink the way we interact with AI—there’s a lot more to consider beyond just the technical efficiency of these systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;bridging-theory-and-practice-in-actuarial-science&#34;&gt;Bridging Theory and Practice in Actuarial Science&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was honored to be invited back as a recent alumna for the &lt;strong&gt;University of Nairobi Actuarial Students Association (NASA) Career Day&lt;/strong&gt;, held under the theme &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Exploring Actuarial Science: Bridging Theory and Practice.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; This topic really resonated with me, as it’s something I grappled with during my undergraduate years—trying to understand how the theory we learned would eventually translate into real-world practice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the time, like many actuarial students, I found myself questioning, &lt;em&gt;Where would I fit in?&lt;/em&gt; When people hear “actuarial science,” they often think of traditional roles in life insurance or pensions. But as I’ve discovered, there are so many more directions this degree can take us, far beyond those conventional paths. That’s why I was excited to not only listen to the esteemed panel but also to speak with the students and share my personal journey.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;commemorating-mazingira-day-with-werunnairobi&#34;&gt;Commemorating Mazingira Day with WeRunNairobi&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On Mazingira Day, I found myself lacing up for a run with WeRunNairobi, and it turned out to be a really rewarding experience. We ran through the Nairobi Arboretum, which was nothing short of serene—trees everywhere, and a peaceful atmosphere that made me forget I was in the middle of the Nairobi.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was one of those moments where I realized just how much the environment gives back to us when we take care of it. The fresh air, the beautiful scenery, and the overall calming vibe made me appreciate the importance of preserving these spaces. It felt like nature’s way of reminding us that when we look after the environment, it looks after us too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;celebrating-achievement-receiving-the-prudential-award&#34;&gt;Celebrating Achievement: Receiving the Prudential Award&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On May 3rd, I had the incredible honor of receiving the Prudential Award during the Student Recognition Ceremony at the University of Nairobi for the academic year 2022/2023. This prestigious award recognizes the top Actuarial Science students and highlights the importance of academic excellence in our field.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Prudential Award is part of the Prudential Actuarial Support System (PASS), an initiative by Prudential Kenya that aims to support and mentor Actuarial Science students, fostering growth and resilience in the industry. It’s not just about recognition; it’s about creating a community of future leaders in actuarial science.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
