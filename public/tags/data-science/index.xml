      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-from-eys-responsible-ai-badge&#34;&gt;Lessons from EY&amp;rsquo;s Responsible AI Badge&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I finished EY’s Responsible AI badge, and it was a real eye-opener. I went into the course hoping to better understand the ethical implications of working with AI, especially generative models like ChatGPT. My focus was on learning how to protect client data when it came to AI, while also ensuring that I stay ethical when using these powerful tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two courses in particular stood out: &lt;em&gt;Data Science Ethics&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, and Ethics&lt;/em&gt;, both from Coursera. They weren’t just theoretical but dove deep into real-world examples, showing the impact of bias, fairness, and transparency. It was fascinating to see how privacy and accountability are not just technical issues but ethical ones too. The courses made me rethink the way we interact with AI—there’s a lot more to consider beyond just the technical efficiency of these systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;bridging-theory-and-practice-in-actuarial-science&#34;&gt;Bridging Theory and Practice in Actuarial Science&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was honored to be invited back as a recent alumna for the &lt;strong&gt;University of Nairobi Actuarial Students Association (NASA) Career Day&lt;/strong&gt;, held under the theme &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Exploring Actuarial Science: Bridging Theory and Practice.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; This topic really resonated with me, as it’s something I grappled with during my undergraduate years—trying to understand how the theory we learned would eventually translate into real-world practice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the time, like many actuarial students, I found myself questioning, &lt;em&gt;Where would I fit in?&lt;/em&gt; When people hear “actuarial science,” they often think of traditional roles in life insurance or pensions. But as I’ve discovered, there are so many more directions this degree can take us, far beyond those conventional paths. That’s why I was excited to not only listen to the esteemed panel but also to speak with the students and share my personal journey.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
