      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;commemorating-mazingira-day-with-werunnairobi&#34;&gt;Commemorating Mazingira Day with WeRunNairobi&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On Mazingira Day, I found myself lacing up for a run with WeRunNairobi, and it turned out to be a really rewarding experience. We ran through the Nairobi Arboretum, which was nothing short of serene—trees everywhere, and a peaceful atmosphere that made me forget I was in the middle of the Nairobi.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was one of those moments where I realized just how much the environment gives back to us when we take care of it. The fresh air, the beautiful scenery, and the overall calming vibe made me appreciate the importance of preserving these spaces. It felt like nature’s way of reminding us that when we look after the environment, it looks after us too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
