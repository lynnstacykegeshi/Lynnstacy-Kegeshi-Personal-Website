      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;finding-my-fit&#34;&gt;Finding My Fit&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was honored to be invited back as a recent alumna for the &lt;strong&gt;University of Nairobi Actuarial Students Association (NASA) Career Day&lt;/strong&gt;, held under the theme &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Exploring Actuarial Science: Bridging Theory and Practice.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; This topic really resonated with me, as it’s something I grappled with during my undergraduate years—trying to understand how the theory we learned would eventually translate into real-world practice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the time, like many actuarial students, I found myself questioning, &lt;em&gt;Where would I fit in?&lt;/em&gt; When people hear “actuarial science,” they often think of traditional roles in life insurance or pensions. But as I’ve discovered, there are so many more directions this degree can take us, far beyond those conventional paths. That’s why I was excited to not only listen to the esteemed panel but also to speak with the students and share my personal journey.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
